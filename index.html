           We are Moms who understand the importance of leaning on other Moms in the difficult times.<br/>

        <h2>Supports We Coordinate</h2>
        <h5>Three friends who could always count on each other for anything - someone to watch the kids for few hours to get an assignment done, 
            someone to drive the kids to scouts or practice, someone to grab toilet paper or laundry detergent when they see it during a pandemic - 
            are what we call SisterWives.  While every Mom needs these supports once in awhile, Moms who are also fighting cancer need them a whole lot more.
            They need more rest so their bodies can recover and recuperate.  They need other Moms to talk to, vent to, and cry with who will understand all of it
            because they are also experiencing it.  They need time to be the woman that they are separate from the mom, spouse, and whatever other hats they wear.
            And because Moms fighting cancer do not need one more thing on their plates, we work to coordinate our volunteer Moms to help whenever and wherever they can.
            Supports we coordinate include:
